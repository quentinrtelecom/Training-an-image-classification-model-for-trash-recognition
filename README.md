# Training-an-image-classification-model-for-trash-recognition
This repository contains a Python project where I trained a classification model to recognize  garbage, including cans, cardboard, packaging and bottles.
I used the pytorch framework, especially the modules torch and torchvision.
The neural network was not made from scratch, I used a pretrained model.
